Create a modern, sleek dashboard UI with the following specifications:

THEME & COLOR SCHEME:
- Primary colors: Black background (#0a0a0a, #141414) with red accents (#ff0040)
- Modern, dark theme with subtle red glowing effects
- Clean, minimalist design with card-based layout

HEADER (Top Section):
- Left corner: Display "Secret Crush" as the logo/slogan in bold red text with a glowing effect
- Right corner: Bell icon with a small red notification dot (to indicate new messages)
- Header should be sticky and have a subtle backdrop blur effect
- Border bottom with dark gray line

SECTION DIFFERENTIATION (CRITICAL):
Each section must be clearly distinguishable and visually separated:
- Use distinct background colors or gradients for each section (darker/lighter variations of black)
- Add clear section headers with large, bold titles and unique icons
- Include horizontal divider lines or spacers between sections (with red accent lines)
- Use different card styles or border colors for each section type
- Add section numbers or labels (e.g., "01 Profile", "02 Credits", "03 Appointments")
- Implement subtle background patterns or textures unique to each section
- Use consistent spacing/padding but vary the internal layout for each section
- Add colored accent bars on the left side of each section (red, dark red, gray variations)
- Consider using collapsible/expandable sections with clear expand/collapse indicators
- Each section should have its own visual "container" feel with proper borders and shadows
- Increase spacing between sections (minimum 3rem gap)
- Use glassmorphism or card elevation differences to create visual hierarchy

MAIN CONTENT AREA (Between Header and Footer):
The content should be scrollable and contain the following sections in order:

1. USER PROFILE SECTION:
   - Display User ID prominently
   - Show Credit balance in a highlighted card

2. CREDIT DETAILS SUBSECTION:
   - Under the credit section, show a list of "who sent the appointment" 
   - Display the money received from each sender
   - Use cards with sender info and amount

3. ONGOING APPOINTMENTS SECTION:
   - Title: "Ongoing Appointments"
   - Scrollable list of appointment cards showing:
     * User ID
     * Date and Time
     * Category
     * Status (with colored badge - green for active, yellow for pending)
   - Each appointment should be in its own card

4. EARNINGS SECTION:
   - Title: "Earnings"
   - Display in a grid or card layout:
     * Total Earnings (large, prominent display)
     * Yearly Earnings
     * Monthly Earnings
   - Each earning metric in its own card with icon

5. MISSED OPPORTUNITIES SECTION:
   - Title: "Missed Opportunities"
   - Show the total money amount from missed opportunities
   - Display in a red-tinted card to highlight the missed revenue

FOOTER (Bottom Section):
- Left side: Settings icon (gear icon)
- Right side: "Quick Edit" text
- Footer should be fixed at the bottom
- Same style as header with backdrop blur

SECURITY & PRIVACY DESIGN ELEMENTS (IMPORTANT):
The UI should make users feel secure and their privacy is protected:
- Add a small padlock icon or shield icon near sensitive information (credit balance, earnings)
- Use subtle blur effects on sensitive data that clears on hover (like credit amounts, user IDs)
- Add "Private" or "Secure" badges with lock icons on sections containing personal data
- Include a privacy indicator in the header (small shield icon with "Secure Connection" text)
- Use darker overlays and frosted glass effects to give a sense of protection
- Add encryption indicators (small lock symbols) next to transaction amounts
- Use subtle border glows in green around secure sections to indicate protection
- Include a "Privacy Mode" toggle option that blurs all sensitive information
- Add tooltips that say "This information is encrypted" when hovering over sensitive data
- Use icons like eye-slash for hidden/protected data
- Add subtle background patterns that suggest security (like digital encryption patterns or circuit board designs)

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Use modern fonts (like Outfit or similar sans-serif for body, Space Mono for headings)
- Add subtle animations on hover and page load
- Cards should have slight elevation/shadow effects with secure-looking borders
- Make it responsive for mobile and desktop
- Use smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- Add a subtle grid or dot pattern in the background with security-themed elements
- Ensure good spacing and breathing room between sections
- All scrollable areas should have custom styled scrollbars
- Dark, professional aesthetic that conveys trust and confidentiality
- Minimal use of bright colors except for the red accent and security indicators (green/blue for secure elements)

TECHNICAL:
- Build as a single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript
- Use modern CSS features (flexbox, grid, custom properties)
- Ensure accessibility (proper contrast ratios, semantic HTML)
- Make the UI functional with sample/dummy data

Please create a complete, working HTML file with all styling and interactivity included.
